export const ABOUT_BIO = `I am a personal fitness coach that helps athletes of all abilities reach their fitness goals. Whether your goal is to get in shape, conquer a 5K, or hit a PR in a triathlon, I have a tailored coaching plan for you!  

I found a passion for running at the age of 15 and never looked back. In 2018, I bought a new bike and started competing in triathlons. With over a decade of experience in running and racing triathlons, I have gained a firsthand understanding how the body responds to training. In 2023, I decided to use this knowledge to help others reach their physical fitness goals and completed the USAT L1 Coaching Certificate to become a certified coach. 

I utilize heart rate data, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and zone training to guide my athletes toward the best results no matter their experience level.

I can't wait to hear about your goals and help you achieve them!`;
