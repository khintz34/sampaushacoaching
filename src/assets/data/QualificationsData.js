  "Hi! I am Coach Sam I am a fitness coach that helps beginner to advanced athletes reach their fitness goals. Whether it be getting into shape, being able to run a 5K, or getting a PR in an IRONMAN, I want to help you hit your goals! I fell in love with running at the age of 15, and I have been a runner ever since. I used (and still use) running to get a mental break from the real world, stay in shape, and ultimately have a goal to work towards. In 2018, I had the means to buy a new bike and started learning about and competing in triathlons. Over the many years I have of running and triathlons, I have built a vast knowledge base of how the body responds to training. In 2023, I decided to use this knowledge to help others reach their physical fitness goals, and I completed the USAT L1 Coaching Certificate to become a certified coach. I utilize heart rate, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and/or zone training during training plans to allow my athletes to get the best results no matter what experience level they have. I can&apos;t wait to hear what your goals are and help you achieve them!";
