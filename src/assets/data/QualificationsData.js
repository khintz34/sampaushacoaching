export const ABOUT_BIO = `Hi! I am Coach Sam!

I am a personal fitness coach that helps athletes of all abilities reach their fitness goals. From getting into shape, running a 5K, or hitting a triathlon PR, I have a coaching plan for you! 

I fell in love with running at the age of 15, and I have been a runner ever since. In 2018 I bought a new bike and started competing in triathlons. Through the years, I have built a vast knowledge base of how the body responds to training. In 2023, I decided to use this knowledge to help others reach their physical fitness goals, and I completed the USAT L1 Coaching Certificate to become a certified coach. 

I utilize heart rate, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and/or zone training during training plans to allow my athletes to get the best results no matter what experience level they have. 

I can't wait to hear what your goals are and help you achieve them!`;
